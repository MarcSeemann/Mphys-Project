# Mphys-Project
All the programs I created during my Mphys project. There are programs to analyse PMT calibration data and find the charge histogram that can be used to deduce the gain of the PMT.

Additionally, there are some programs for data binning to reduce data size.

There are also some programs for running a toy simulation to find the activity at a detector some distance away from the source. A pure alpha source is assumed.

Finally, there are some programs that where used for data analysis for the three different experiments conducted.
